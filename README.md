# WYSIWYG RICH TEXT EDITOR - in progress...

Experimenting and going deeper with WEB API.
Building a Rich text editor without external libraries.

## Goals

- Will not use the "document.execCommand"
- Will not use "innerHTML"

## Why React?

There is not actual need for React here, however i'm planning to extend this to use in my own React project.
You can use the code in any Vanilla js project.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
